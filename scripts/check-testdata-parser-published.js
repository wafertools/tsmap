// Release guard: catches the exact failure mode that let `packages/parsers`
// (the shared Rust/WASM parser crate, published as `@wafertools/testdata-parser`)
// drift silently for a month — real source changes shipped in tsmap v0.1.20 via
// the native build's Cargo path dependency (which always compiles the crate from
// source, regardless of npm state), while the browser/WASM build kept running
// the stale published package, because nothing checked whether the crate's
// *version* actually moved when its *source* did. Unlike wmap, this crate has
// no local-link dev workflow — the native build's source-of-truth being "always
// current" is exactly what let the web build's staleness go unnoticed.
//
// Fails (exit 1) if any of:
//   0. @wafertools/testdata-parser is currently LINKED (`npm run parser:link`,
//      node_modules/@wafertools/testdata-parser is a symlink) — the build
//      would embed a local, unpublished wasm bundle.
//   1. packages/parsers/src (or Cargo.toml) has changed since the version in
//      Cargo.toml was last bumped — the crate's source has drifted ahead of
//      its own version number, so a bump + publish is needed before release.
//   2. packages/parsers/Cargo.toml's version doesn't match the range pinned
//      in package.json's @wafertools/testdata-parser dependency — the crate
//      was bumped locally but package.json was never updated to point at it.
//   3. package.json's pinned range doesn't resolve to a version actually
//      published on npm — bumped and pinned, but never `npm publish`ed.
//
// Runs only from `build`/`release` (NOT predev), mirroring check-wmap-published.js.
// Tolerant of a shallow git clone (check 1) and of npm being unreachable
// (check 3) — warns and continues rather than blocking a build on something
// it can't actually verify (e.g. CI's default shallow checkout).
