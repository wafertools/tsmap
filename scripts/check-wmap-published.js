// Release guard: refuses to build a shippable tsmap against a wmap that users
// can't get. tsmap is developed against a LOCAL, often-unpublished wmap (see the
// `npm run wmap:link` batch workflow in CLAUDE.md) — that's fine for dev, but a
// release must resolve to a published, version-matched wmap or it'll be a
// "works on my machine" build that npm ci can't reproduce.
//
// Fails (exit 1) if either:
//   1. wmap is currently LINKED (node_modules/@wafertools/wafermap is a symlink) —
//      the build would embed local, unpublished code; or
//   2. the wmap version range in package.json does not resolve to a version that
//      is actually published on npm.
//
// Runs only from `build`/`release` (NOT predev), so it never blocks the local
// link-and-iterate loop. Network-tolerant: if npm can't be reached it warns and
// passes rather than blocking an offline release build.
