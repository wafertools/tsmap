# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.25] — 2026-08-09

CSV/JSON test numbers are now stable across reordering (2026-08-09), a follow-up to
M7 below: duplicate-role validation stopped two columns silently sharing a number,
but the underlying numbers were still fragile in a different way.

### Changed

- **CSV/JSON test numbers no longer depend on column or row order.** They used to be assigned `1001, 1002, …` — for wide format, in the order columns appeared in the mapping table; for long format, in the order test names were first encountered while scanning rows. Either one meant re-parsing the same logical test set after a column was added/removed/reordered, or after a file was re-exported in a different row order, silently renumbered every test — invalidating any saved test list or override keyed by number, with no warning. Numbers are now a deterministic hash of the test's own identity (the source column for wide format, the test name for long format — see `stableTestNumber` in `lib.ts` and its independent Rust mirror in `testdata-parser`'s new `test_identity.rs`), collision-probed so two different tests in one file can never land on the same number. Real STDF/ATDF test numbers are untouched — this only affects the two formats that never had a real test number to begin with.
- **A new `order` field, independent of the number, drives display order.** The test selector used to sort by test number, which happened to equal file order only because numbers were assigned in file order — a coincidence this change would otherwise have broken, since a hashed number has no relationship to where its column sits. `order` (column position for wide format, first-encounter order for long format; absent for STDF/ATDF, where sorting by the real number is still correct) now carries that instead, so tests still list in the file's own order despite the number itself being an arbitrary large integer.
- **Loading a saved test list now recovers a stale number by matching on name.** If a row's saved number isn't in the current scan, its name is checked against the current tests before giving up — this is what makes a saved list, or a list a user hand-edited, survive the numbering scheme changing (or any other renumbering) without needing to know why the number went stale. A name matching more than one current test is never guessed; it's counted and reported separately from a genuinely-unknown test. The load summary now distinguishes three outcomes instead of two: matched by number (silent, as before), recovered by name (new — an info-level note suggesting the list be re-saved), and not found (unchanged). `docs/user-guide.md`'s Test lists section, which documented the old two-outcome "silently skipped" behaviour outright, is updated to match.

### Internal

- The wide-format numbering fix lives in TS (`mappingUI.ts`'s `readMapping` — wide-format numbers are assigned there, before the mapping ever reaches Rust); the long-format fix is duplicated in Rust across `parse_csv.rs` and `parse_json.rs`, which have always had separate, near-identical long-format pivot logic. The two hashing implementations don't need to agree numerically — TS's wide-format numbers and Rust's long-format numbers are computed independently and never compared — but Rust's long-format pass seeds its collision set with whatever wide-format numbers the same mapping already assigned, so the two schemes can't collide within one file even when a mapping combines both (the mapping UI allows this: some columns "Test value", others "Test name"/"Test result").
- The stale-number recovery logic was extracted into a pure, exported `resolveLoadedTestList` (`testSelectorUI.ts`) rather than left inline in the DOM-driven load handler, so it has direct unit test coverage instead of only being reachable through the full overlay.
- Verified end-to-end through the real WASM path, not just `cargo test`: the parsers crate has no local-link workflow for the web build (see this file's "Shared parsers crate" section), so a local `wasm-pack build` was temporarily swapped into `node_modules` to confirm the hash survives the actual browser-facing boundary, then reverted — the published `@wafertools/testdata-parser` package is unchanged on disk. **The crate version must still be bumped and published before any release**, per the existing rule; nothing here does that automatically.

### Fixed

- **A long-format CSV/JSON with a `test_val`-style value column silently collapsed to one test.** `detectRole`'s auto-detection only matched the exact strings `test_value`/`val`/`meas_val`/etc. for the "Test result (long format)" role — a real-world column literally named `test_val` (the bundled `testdata/correlated_long.csv` fixture; presumably not unique to it) matched none of them and fell through to the numeric-fallback heuristic, which classified it as a single ordinary wide-format "Test value" column instead. With `testvalueCol` then unset, the file silently parsed as wide-format with that one bogus column — no error, no warning, ~30 real tests reduced to 1. Added regex fallbacks for both `testname` and `testvalue` (mirroring the existing `loLimit`/`hiLimit`/`units` regex patterns, added for the identical reason: an exact-string list doesn't scale to every real header spelling). Verified against the actual fixture end-to-end: all 30 tests now load. The guide's column-mapping screenshot was captured against the same fixture and silently documented the bug (`test_val` shown mapped to plain "Test value") — recaptured.
- **"Add files" followed by cancelling the column-mapping overlay left a permanently blank window.** `showMappingOverlay` cleared `#map-container` as a side effect of opening, on the assumption it only ever ran before anything was rendered. `handleFiles()` is the shared path for both *Open file* and *Add files*, so appending a CSV to an existing gallery wiped that gallery the moment the overlay appeared — and cancelling restored nothing, leaving the app showing an empty view while still holding the wafers (Add, Splits and Filter tests all stayed enabled). The clear also bypassed `destroyMainView()`, leaking wmap's controller and observers. Clearing the view belongs to `handleFiles`, which does it via `showLoadingState()` only after the cancellable gates resolve; the overlay no longer touches the container at all.
- **Resizing the window permanently retitled the app to an error string.** A module-load debug handler in `index.html` rewrote `document.title` on *any* window error event, and wmap's `ResizeObserver` emits the benign "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications" notice during an ordinary resize. The title then stayed `ERR: …` for the rest of the session — the browser tab on web, the OS window title and taskbar entry on desktop, reading as a crash. The handler now fires only for genuine script errors (an error with a source file) and only before the app has booted.
- **wmap's Summary panel rendered near-invisible dark-on-dark text on every dark theme (Dark, Nord, Solarized Dark).** wmap reads its chrome colours from 26 `--wmap-*` custom properties (`WMAP_TOKEN_NAMES` in its own source); tsmap's `:root` block mapped only 20 of them to tsmap's own tokens. The other 6 aren't unstyled when unmapped — wmap falls back to its own hardcoded *light-theme* defaults, because that's what keeps the library usable in a host that sets no theme at all. The one that actually bit: `--wmap-text-strong` (wmap's `CLR.value`, used for the Summary panel's headings and big stat numbers) fell back to `#1f2f43` — near-black — landing on a near-black panel background at under 1.1:1 contrast on every dark theme. `--wmap-err-bg`/`--wmap-err-border`/`--wmap-err-text` and `--wmap-finding-indicator` had the identical gap, just not yet exercised by anything visible in normal use. All six are now mapped; `--wmap-z` is the one token left deliberately unmapped, since tsmap's own z-index scale is defined *above* it on purpose rather than substituted for it.
- **The toolbar pushed the theme picker and Help button off-screen below ~900px**, with no wrap and no overflow, so they could not be scrolled to or revealed. The decorative "or drop a file anywhere" hint now drops out at ≤1100px and the title at ≤700px, and the bar scrolls horizontally as a hard floor. Measured: the right-hand group is reachable at every width down to 640px.
- **The column-mapping Role dropdowns were indistinguishable from text inputs.** `appearance: none` removed the native arrow with no replacement, leaving them pixel-identical to the real text inputs in the adjacent *Test name* column. They now draw a caret (built from gradients rather than an SVG data URI, so it follows the theme).
- **The test selector's memory advisory was never themed.** It read `var(--error, …)` and `var(--warn, …)`; neither token has ever existed (the themes define `--error-text`/`--warn-text`), so all eight themes fell through to hardcoded hex — putting `#fbbf24` amber on High contrast's white ground at about 1.9:1.
- **Column mapping silently accepted duplicate roles.** Two columns set to the same single-valued role (X, Y, wafer, lot, bin, …) resolved by last-one-wins overwrite, discarding the first with no feedback and producing a plausible-looking map built from the wrong column. Now blocked before parsing, with a message naming every clash.
- **"Filter tests…" dropped the memory advisory and the themed confirm.** Both were passed only on the initial load — backwards, since this is the path that can *widen* a selection and force a re-parse. The prompts also fell back to a bare `window.confirm` on this path while using the native themed dialog on the other.
- **The rename overlay and append confirmation had no keyboard exit.** Neither responded to Escape, the rename overlay had no initial focus and ignored Enter, and the append confirmation had no backdrop-click, `role="dialog"` or `aria-modal` — the only two dialogs in the app without any of it. The append confirmation now goes through the shared `openModal`; the rename overlay commits on Enter, cancels on Escape and focuses its first field.
- **Append warnings could print the literal string "undefined"** for a file with no hard-bin column (`hbin` is optional and landed in the bin set), and the "Wafer grid size differs" check only ever compared the X span, so a differing row count passed silently.
- **The primary button failed WCAG AA in four themes.** White on `--btn-primary-bg` measured 2.5:1 in Light green, 3.4:1 in Solarized Dark, 3.7:1 in Solarized Light and 4.0:1 in Nord. A new `--btn-primary-text` token lets Light green use dark ink on its bright brand green (6.5:1) instead of forcing the green darker; Nord and both Solarized themes take their button ground two steps down the same hue (5.1–6.2:1), with `--accent` left at each palette's exact published value so links and active chrome are unchanged.
- **Nord's and Solarized Dark's `--error-text` failed AA against their own app background** (3.05:1 and 3.25:1 respectively) — found while wiring up the new `--wmap-err-*` mapping above, since that reuses `--error-text` and would otherwise have carried the same failure into wmap's own error banner. Both lightened along their existing hue until they clear 4.5:1 against every surface they're actually shown on (Nord 4.54–4.80:1, Solarized Dark 4.82–5.17:1) — still recognisably "Nord red" / "Solarized red", not a different colour family. New `--error-bg`/`--error-border` tokens were added to all eight themes to pair with `--error-text`, mirroring the existing `--warn-bg`/`--warn-border`/`--warn-text` triad.
- **The drop-zone frame advertised two things it did not do** — `cursor: pointer` and a hover highlight with no click handler of its own (only the nested button responded), and a `.drag-over` style that no code ever applied. Both are now wired, on desktop and web.
- **No favicon.** `/favicon.ico` 404'd on every load of the web app; the app now ships a wafer glyph matching its own empty state, which follows the viewer's OS theme.

### Changed

- **Keyboard focus is now visible.** The app previously defined no `:focus` or `:focus-visible` rule anywhere and relied on the UA ring, which resolves near-invisibly against the dark themes' chrome — and most of the UI is built in JS with inline styles. One global rule reaches all of it. The custom dropdown's options, which are `role="option"` divs that never take DOM focus, gained an accent marker: the background swap that was previously the only indicator measured about 1.2:1 on the Dark theme.
- **Modal dialogs follow the APG pattern properly** — Tab is trapped inside the dialog, focus returns to whatever opened it, and Escape inside a text field now blurs the field instead of tearing down the whole dialog (typing a split name and pressing Escape used to close the Splits dialog outright).
- **The custom dropdown stops Escape and Enter from propagating.** Its handler runs in the capture phase, so without this an Escape that closed the menu carried on to `modal.ts`'s document listener and closed the surrounding dialog too — latent today, and guaranteed the moment a menu is used inside a modal.
- **Column mapping scales to wide files** — a column filter, "set everything shown to Test value / Ignore", and a "Reset to auto-detected" that also forgets the saved mapping (previously there was no in-app route back to detection once a mapping had been remembered for a header set).
- **The Splits dialog** commits on Enter in the name field, logs "Clear split" like every other mutating action, and puts the in-use split chips directly under the field they fill rather than several rows below it.

### Removed

- **`src/printTheme.ts`**, which nothing had imported since the print-only guide page was removed. A comment in `scripts/build-user-guide.mjs` claimed it was "still used at runtime for the lot summary report" — it was not; that report is wmap's own HTML, passed through `platform.openReport` untouched.

### Internal

- `escapeHtml` and `basename` were each defined twice (in `mappingUI`/`multiFileUI`, and in `lib`/`recentFiles`); both now live once in `lib.ts`. The Splits dialog's chip builder existed as two verbatim copies. The `overlay-open` body class was added and removed by two modules but styled by none.
- `recentFiles.ts` gained tests — it was the only non-trivial pure module without any — covering the order-insensitive dedupe key and `formatRecentTime`'s month- and year-crossing boundaries. Suite: 197 → 228 tests.

## [0.1.24] — 2026-08-07

### Added

- **`tsmap --version` / `tsmap -V`** prints the version and exits. It previously hit the CLI's unrecognized-flag rule and failed with usage text and exit 1 — despite the project's own docs describing it as the way to read the binary's version. The string comes from `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, which the existing version-sync guard already pins to `package.json`, so it cannot drift from the version shown in the app. Lowercase `-v` is deliberately not an alias and remains an unrecognized option.

### Changed

- **wmap bumped to 0.22.0** (from 0.21.1), published and pinned at `^0.22.0`. Brings the library's own warning surfacing (a ⚠ toolbar indicator and Summary-panel banner, on by default) and a redundancy collapse in findings, so one edge failure no longer produces a hard-bin row, its identical soft-bin twin, a pass-bin row and a yield row all restating the same fact. Its one breaking change — `StatsSummary.stats.warnings` becoming `WaferWarning[]` rather than `string[]` — does not affect tsmap, which never read that field. 0.22.0 also withdrew four undocumented view-pipeline helpers (`findTestDef`, `resolveTestNumber`, `getUniqueTestNumbers`, `generateTextOverlay`); tsmap uses none of them.

### Fixed

- **wmap advisories about skipped analysis never reached the log panel.** Since wmap 0.22.0 the library raises advisories from two places — the map build (inferred geometry: `partial-coverage`, `geometry-conflict`, `inferred-pitch`) and the analysis (`test-count-capped`). tsmap read only the first, so `test-count-capped` — whose entire meaning is "test-value analysis was skipped and **no** test findings were produced" — was silently dropped, in the case where a user is most likely to wonder why the Insights and Findings panels are empty. `logWmapWarnings` now goes through wmap's own `collectWarnings`, which unions both sources and de-duplicates, and so runs after `analyzeWaferMap` rather than before it.

### Changed

- **Log entries for wmap advisories now carry their severity and code.** A geometry advisory is graded `error` by wmap (dies may be drawn in the wrong place) and now logs as an error — which opens the log panel — rather than as one more `warn` scrolling past; `test-count-capped` stays a warning. Each line names the stable advisory code, e.g. `Wafer W03 [partial-coverage]: …`.
- wmap's own warning indicator (new in 0.22.0, on by default) is deliberately left on alongside the log: the toolbar indicator is discoverable and persists with the map, the log keeps the per-wafer history.
- `eslint.config.js` now ignores the workspace-root `target/` and `.venv/`. Both are generated, and the config already claimed to ignore build output — but this is a Cargo workspace, so Rust/Tauri output lands at the root rather than under the already-ignored `src-tauri/`. `npm run lint` was unaffected (it is scoped to `src`); a bare `eslint .` reported over a thousand parse errors from generated assets.

## [0.1.23] — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **Dependencies renamed to the `wafertools` npm scope** — `@paulrobins/wafermap` → `@wafertools/wafermap` (pin bumped `^0.20.9` → `^0.21.1` in the same change) and `@paulrobins/testdata-parser` → `@wafertools/testdata-parser`. No functional change; both are scope moves. The GitHub org for both `tsmap` and `wmap` also moved from `telecasterer` to `wafertools`.

### Fixed

- **Yield was being overstated — real probed dies at the wafer edge were silently discarded (wmap 0.20.9).** wmap derived each die's "partial" flag by testing it against the wafer circle, but for data loaded from a file that circle is *inferred*, and an undersized guess marked real tested sites as edge-straddling — greying them out and dropping them from every yield and statistic. A die carrying test results is by definition a site the prober stepped to, so it can never straddle the edge. On the bundled `correlated.stdf` (9865 dies) the effect was 160 dies: stats counted 9705 of them, lot yield read 66.6% instead of **65.5%**, and ring 4 (edge) yield read 20.8% instead of **17.6%**. Every recovered die was a *failing* edge die, so displayed yields drop slightly and are now correct. The toolbar die count and the Insights/summary N also agree again (they differed by exactly the phantom dies). All user-guide screenshots recaptured.
- **wmap's per-wafer advisories now reach the log on single-wafer loads too** — `buildWaferMap`'s warnings (inferred geometry, and 0.20.9's new `geometry-conflict`/`inferred-pitch` codes) were logged for gallery loads but silently dropped when a file contained one wafer, which is the case where a geometry warning is easiest to act on.

## [0.1.22] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Help menu feedback** — the "tsmap guide" row is marked with an external-link icon (it's the one row that leaves the app for your browser), and both rows show a brief confirmation toast on click. On desktop the guide can reopen into an already-running but minimized browser window, where nothing visibly happens; the toast confirms the click registered so it doesn't get retried. Only one toast is shown at a time, and it's announced to screen readers (`role="status"`).
- **Marketing pages for the docs site** — a [Features](docs/features.md) tour and a [Use cases](docs/use-cases.md) page, both illustrated with real captured screenshots, plus a "Why tsmap"/"See it in action" section on the docs home page.

### Changed

- **wmap bumped to 0.20.8** (from 0.20.3, the last released pin — 0.20.4 was picked up but never shipped). Drop-in for tsmap, no code changes needed. Brings: viewport clamping for the Test Value submenu and Insights tooltips, expand-modal reparent/close fixes and correct printing of an expanded modal (0.20.4); no more double SI-prefixing when a test's unit is already prefixed, e.g. `MHz`/`nA` rendering as "1.50 kMHz" (0.20.5); a `'metadata'` plot mode and several reticle placement/labelling correctness fixes (0.20.6/0.20.7); and a geometry rewrite onto a single affine transform pipeline that fixes a backwards +X/+Y axis indicator under a data-axis flip, overlapping die rectangles when a non-square die pitch meets a baked wafer orientation, and axis tick labels naming the wrong die coordinate when orientation, data flip and interactive rotation are combined (0.20.8). See WMAP_ISSUES.md's version table.
- **Documented parser throughput now names the machine it was measured on** — the public figures were quoting a benchmark that predated the testdata-parser 0.4.0 rewrite. Re-measured: ~3.5 s / ~96 MB/s for a 341 MB, 266k-die STDF lot on a 2021 ThinkPad, against ~2.3 s / ~148 MB/s on a small desktop; both are now quoted with their hardware rather than a single context-free number.

### Fixed

- **Screenshot captures fail loudly again.** The capture steps that drive wmap's Insights tab locate their targets by its user-visible heading/tab text (its DOM exposes no stable class/id/aria hooks — WMAP_ISSUES.md #36), and every one of them silently did nothing when a match failed, producing a valid-looking screenshot of the wrong state under the right filename — the same defect that shipped six wrong images in July. All four now throw. Also fixed the drilldown capture baking wmap's cursor-following chart tooltip over the data it was meant to show.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Test list files can now carry spec limits and test type, not just selection/renames** — the test selector's **Save list**/**Load list** and the CLI `--tests <file>` flag accept an extended, header-driven format: optional `loLimit`/`hiLimit`/`units`/`testType` columns alongside `num`/`name`, letting the file double as a lightweight test-definitions file. Useful for characterisation/test-vehicle work, where spec limits are often defined by simulation or adjusted separately from the test program rather than shipped in the STDF/ATDF data itself. A header row (if present) is matched case-insensitively with common synonyms (`lsl`/`usl` for the limit columns, `type`/`test-type` for test type), can list columns in any order or subset, and old header-less 2-column files keep parsing exactly as before. A specified value always overrides whatever the parser found; a blank field leaves it alone. Loaded/overridden values are shown as always-visible limits and type columns in the selector (previously only shown for the raw parsed value, and only as an occasional override tag) — read-only, since Save/Load is the entire edit workflow, there's no in-app editor. Limits specified for a functional test are dropped with a warning (a pass/fail test has no measured value to check a limit against).

### Changed

- **`@paulrobins/testdata-parser` bumped to 0.5.0** — republishes the functional-test (`testPass`) parser support that shipped in v0.1.20 for the native/desktop build (via the local Cargo crate) but was never pushed to npm, leaving the browser/WASM build silently running the stale 0.4.0 parser for a month with no `testPass` data. Now current on both platforms.
- **New release guard**: `scripts/check-testdata-parser-published.js` (wired into `prebuild`/`prebuild:web`, alongside the existing wmap guard) fails a release build if `packages/parsers/src` has changed since the crate's version was last bumped, if `packages/parsers/Cargo.toml`'s version doesn't match `package.json`'s pinned range, or if that range doesn't resolve to an actually-published npm version — the exact gap that let the above go unnoticed.

## [0.1.20] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Command-line file arguments** — `tsmap file1.stdf file2.stdf` opens files directly from a terminal. `--list <file>` reads a newline-delimited list of paths (blank/`#`-comment lines skipped). `--tests <file>` pre-fills the test selector's selection/renames from a saved test list (the same CSV the selector's own **Save list** button produces) — the selector still always opens for a final confirm, per the existing "always shown" rule, it just saves re-picking tests you already chose. `--splits <file>` applies a wafer-splits CSV automatically, the same way the bundled sample lot's splits already do. With no files/`--list` given and stdin piped (never when run interactively), a newline-delimited file list is read from stdin instead. `-h`/`--help` prints full usage. See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md#command-line) and CLAUDE.md for details.
- **Single-instance forwarding** — launching `tsmap <files>` while an instance is already running hands the files to that window instead of opening a blank second one (`tauri-plugin-single-instance`). With nothing loaded yet, the files open immediately. With data already loaded, a confirmation dialog asks before replacing the view — declining opens the new files in a separate, independent window instead of discarding them. `--new-instance` also lets anyone open a second window deliberately, bypassing the prompt.
- **CLI argument validation** — an unrecognized flag (`--` or single-dash) is now a hard error rather than being silently dropped or misread as a data-file path (e.g. a typo'd `-tests` no longer becomes a bogus "file" named `-tests`). A value flag (`--list`/`--tests`/`--splits`) with a missing value, or one immediately followed by another flag, also errors instead of silently swallowing the next flag as its value.
- **Functional (pass/fail) tests are now first-class** — a test with no measured value, only a recorded pass/fail outcome (continuity, boundary scan, any go/no-go test), no longer gets faked into a `0.0`/`1.0` parametric value with meaningless boxplot/histogram/Cpk/correlation entries. STDF TEST_FLG and ATDF PTR `PASS_FAIL` (previously unread, despite being in the spec) now populate a new `DieResult.testPass` verdict channel, kept separate from `testValues`; FTR records write a verdict only. wmap 0.20.3 (see below) renders this via `passFailDisplay: 'test'` — solid green/red per die instead of a meaningless value gradient — and a "Functional Tests" pass-rate table replaces parametric stats for these tests everywhere (Summary panel, Insights, regional findings). **Desktop only for now** — the native build already ships this (it uses the parsers crate directly), but the browser/WASM build still produces legacy-encoded functional data until `@paulrobins/testdata-parser` is republished (falls back gracefully; see WMAP_ISSUES.md #34). Also fixed a related bug the end-to-end pass surfaced: every `generate_stdf*.py` script was writing a non-spec FTR record (wrong field width, test name in the wrong slot), which silently lost functional test names in the UI ("Test 2001" instead of "scan_chain") — `sample_data/PVT-LOT-05.stdf`/`sample-lot.stdf.gz` regenerated with the fix.

### Changed

- **wmap bumped to 0.20.3** — adds the first-class functional-test (pass/fail) support described above (`TestDef.testType`, `DieResult.testPass`, `passFailDisplay`) — see WMAP_ISSUES.md #34.

### Fixed

- **Toolbar's loaded-file info could wrap onto multiple lines and double the toolbar's height** for a long filename/path. Now truncates with an ellipsis and shows the full text on hover.
- **`tsmap` crashed with a `GLIBC_PRIVATE` symbol lookup error when launched from a terminal that had inherited a snap-packaged app's GTK/GDK/GIO environment variables** (VS Code's snap build, in particular) — these pointed GTK's module loader at `.so` files bundled inside the snap, which pulled in an incompatible `libpthread` at load time. Now stripped at startup on Linux, unconditionally, regardless of how tsmap is invoked.

## [0.1.19] — 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Splits dialog status banner** — a banner at the top of the **Splits…** dialog now shows where things stand: with no assignments yet it explains the two ways to get started (tick wafers and assign below, or load a saved CSV — with its own **Load splits…** shortcut button); once splits exist it becomes a live summary, e.g. *"5 splits assigned to 13 of 13 wafers"*, so a lot whose splits were auto-restored (like the bundled sample data) reads as already done rather than a task waiting to be repeated.

### Changed

- **Splits dialog selection is now visibly action-scoped** — **Assign to selected** and **Clear split** are disabled until at least one wafer is ticked (previously they silently did nothing), the assign button shows a live count ("Assign to 3 selected"), and a hint line explains the disabled state. This distinguishes the splits dialog's transient ticking (scope for the next action) from the test selector's checked-means-imported semantics — the two dialogs look alike and are often seen back to back, which misled users into thinking "Select all" was required here too.
- **wmap bumped to 0.20.2** — Analysis tab reorganized into the opt-in **Insights** tab (`insights: { enabled }` replaces `analysisEnabled`), Summary panel findings filters and combined "Summary report" button, wafer/lot metadata badge, and the new `onSaveText` host hook. tsmap wires `onSaveText` through `platform.saveTextFile`, fixing the Insights tab's **Export CSV** button on desktop (WMAP_ISSUES.md #33); Help menu copy updated to match the Insights naming.
- `npm run wmap:link` creates the `../wmap` symlink directly instead of going through `npm link`, so it no longer depends on npm's global prefix being writable; behaviour is otherwise identical and both guard scripts detect the link the same way.
- Guide screenshot capture (`scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`) honours a `CHROME_PATH` env var for environments where Playwright's bundled Chromium is unavailable, and the `loadSplitsFile` step tolerates the splits dialog's second "Load splits…" button.

## [0.1.18] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Inline test renaming in the test selector** — click a test's name to edit it directly (looks like plain text until hovered/focused; Enter or click-away commits, Esc reverts). Renames persist across "Filter tests…" re-opens and are included in **Save list**, using the same `nameOverrides` mechanism as loading a hand-edited test list file.
- **Recent files** (desktop only) — the last 8 opened file sets are remembered, each with a last-loaded timestamp, for one-click reopen with a remove (×) button. Shown both on the empty state and via a new toolbar **Recent** button that stays available once a file is loaded (not just from the empty state). Persisted to `localStorage`. Requires a native file path to reopen, so this is not shown on the web build.
- **"Load sample data" on the empty state** — loads a bundled synthetic 13-wafer, 5-process-corner demo lot (`sample_data/PVT-LOT-05.stdf`, gzipped to 106 KB) through the normal load pipeline, so a first-time user (or someone getting past the unsigned-installer security warning) can see the app work before opening their own files. Works on both platforms: desktop reads it via a bundled Tauri resource path (`bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json`), web fetches it as a static asset — both go through the existing transparent `.gz` decompression, no new parsing code. Its matching process-corner splits (`PVT-LOT-05_splits.csv`) load alongside it and apply automatically via the existing splits auto-restore mechanism, so the demo shows off the **Splits…** feature immediately with no extra step.
- **Single Help menu** — the toolbar `?` button now opens a small menu with two entries: **tsmap guide** (always available) and **Wafer map reference** (enabled once a map/gallery is loaded), replacing what used to be two separate help buttons in two different toolbars.

### Changed

- **User guide rebuilt as a single, self-contained, offline-capable page**, replacing the old in-app modal + separate print-page + GitHub-Pages-hosted-image system entirely. `scripts/build-user-guide.mjs` now compiles `docs/user-guide.md` directly into a standalone HTML page (`public/guide/index.html`) with every image bundled alongside it — no runtime reachability probing, no online/offline fallback text, no coupling to the GitHub Pages deploy schedule. It opens as a bundled local file via the system browser on desktop (fully offline) and a same-origin page on the web build. Printing/saving as PDF is now just the browser's native Ctrl+P on a real page — the old custom print-HTML wrapper is gone. `src/userGuideHtml.ts`, `src/guideImages.ts`, and `src/userGuidePrint.ts` were deleted.
- **All 7 hand-authored HTML "mockups" of tsmap's own UI in the guide (toolbar, column mapping, wafer rename, append-confirm, test selector, splits dialog, log panel) replaced with real captured screenshots** — they no longer silently drift from the actual UI. `docs/tsmap-theme.css` (the CSS that used to style the mockups) was deleted along with them. `scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`/`capture-definitions.mjs` gained new setup steps (`loadFiles`, `addFiles`, `dismissSelectorThenRename`, `shrinkPanelToContent`) to support capturing these states.
- **wmap bumped to 0.19.0** — exports `openUserGuide()` on both `WaferMapController` and `GalleryController` so a host can open wmap's guide window without a button/DOM dependency; the guide window itself now tries a real `window.open()` popup before falling back to the in-page floating window (mirrors the existing gallery-card-detach pattern). See WMAP_ISSUES.md #32 for the full history, including a same-version wmap fix for a bug where the guide's live demo widgets rendered as empty divs.

### Fixed

- **Shared themed tooltip could render behind later-appended overlays** — `getTooltip()` only appended its singleton element to `<body>` the first time it was ever shown; after that it reused the already-connected node without moving it. Since CSS breaks equal-z-index ties by DOM order, any modal/menu/popup appended to `<body>` afterward (e.g. the new Recent dropdown) would silently outrank the tooltip in paint order despite `--z-tooltip` being the documented top tier. Now re-appends (moves to the end) on every show, so it's always last regardless of what else has been added since.
- **Caught Tauri command errors displayed as "undefined" in the log panel** — `invoke()` rejects with whatever the Rust command's `Err` serialises to (a plain string for `Result<T, String>`), not an `Error` instance, so the codebase-wide `(e as Error).message` pattern silently read as `undefined` and discarded the real message everywhere it was used (7 call sites in `main.ts`). Added `errMsg()` in `lib.ts` (handles `Error`, string, or anything else) and switched every call site to it.
- **"Load sample data" failed with ENOENT on desktop** — `bundle.resources` was configured as a bare string array (`["../sample_data/sample-lot.stdf.gz"]`); Tauri rewrites `..` segments in that form to a literal `_up_` in the resource tree, so the real registered key was `_up_/sample_data/sample-lot.stdf.gz`, not `sample-lot.stdf.gz` as the JS code assumed. Switched to the `{ "source": "target" }` object form, which pins the target name explicitly and avoids the rewrite.
- **Shared themed tooltip text could overflow its background box** — `white-space: pre-wrap` only wraps at existing whitespace/newlines, so a long unbroken string (e.g. a filesystem path, which has no spaces) had nowhere to wrap and spilled past the fixed 280px width instead of staying inside it. Added `overflow-wrap: break-word`.
- Test-name renames were not carried into a later "Filter tests…" re-open — the selector re-seeded from the original first-pass scan, so a rename applied on the initial load appeared to silently revert when reopening the filter dialog (the render/export path was unaffected — only the selector's own display was stale).
- **The Tauri guide-open permission had no effective scope** — `opener:allow-open-path` was listed as a bare permission string, which the plugin itself documents as granting nothing ("without any pre-configured scope"); the guide's Help button silently failed to open on desktop. Fixed by adding an explicit `{ "path": "$RESOURCE/**" }` scope.
- **The web build's guide link silently opened the app itself instead of the guide** — Vite's dev server doesn't resolve a directory-index request (`/guide/`) the way a production static host does, so it fell through to the app's own SPA shell. Fixed by linking to `guide/index.html` explicitly.
- **Guide screenshots displayed at up to double their real size, and squashed out of aspect ratio once wider than the reading column** — every screenshot is captured at `deviceScaleFactor: 2` for crisp text, but nothing told the browser that, so images rendered at their raw (2x) pixel size; and once explicit `width`/`height` were added to fix that, wide images lost their aspect ratio under `max-width: 100%` because `height` stayed pinned to its literal attribute value. Fixed by emitting half-scale `width`/`height` attributes (read from each PNG's real dimensions) and adding `height: auto` alongside `max-width: 100%`.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Wafer splits** — assign a process-corner/experiment label to wafers via a new **Splits…** dialog (bulk select with checkbox + shift-click, CSV save/load, auto-restore on later reloads of the same lot). Splits are stored as an ordinary per-wafer metadata field, so every existing grouped chart (yield, boxplot, histogram, correlation, scatter) picks them up with zero changes.
- **In-place group drill-down for Yield and Boxplot** — clicking a grouped bar/box now redraws the same panel one level down to that group's individual wafers, with a **← Back** button to return, instead of always opening a wafer-map modal. Only a genuine wafer-level bar opens the modal.
- **In-app user guide images** — the `?` guide modal shows real screenshots again, loaded from GitHub Pages. A reachability probe (HEAD request against a permanent probe image, with a timeout) runs once per guide open and gates whether images load at all; falls back to a text-only guide with an online-guide link when offline, and each image gets its own `onerror` fallback for the case where general connectivity is fine but one specific image hasn't been published yet. Status is logged to the log panel.

### Changed

- **wmap bumped to 0.18.0** — gallery card detach gets an automatic in-page floating-window fallback when `window.open()` is blocked (fixes a real regression under Tauri), plus a `showExpandButton` option to suppress the redundant expand button/`E` key when wmap is already rendered inside a tsmap modal.
- Screenshot/doc-generation pipeline overhaul (`scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`, `scripts/capture-definitions.mjs`); user guide screenshots regenerated.
- CI: GitHub Actions dependency version bumps in the Pages deploy workflow.

### Fixed

- **Wafer-splits auto-restore collided across unrelated files** — the restore fingerprint was keyed on wafer ID alone, so two different lots that happened to share a generic wafer-ID convention (`W01`, `W02`, …) would silently inherit each other's split assignments. Now keyed on lot ID + part type + wafer ID (the physical wafer's identity, not the file), so a lot split across several files (e.g. one per test temperature) still restores correctly while unrelated lots no longer collide.
- **Web build hung when the native file picker was cancelled** — closing the Open/Add file dialog via Cancel, Esc, or its own close button left the toolbar stuck on "Waiting for file selection…" forever, since `<input type="file">`'s `change` event never fires on cancel. Now listens for the `cancel` event to reset the UI.
- Pre-push lint error (`prefer-const`) that was blocking pushes.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-07-03

### Added

- **8-theme colour picker** (Auto, Light, Light green, Solarized Light, High contrast, Dark, Nord, Solarized Dark) via a new themed dropdown (`menuSelect.ts`) that avoids native `<select>` misbehaviour on Linux WebKitGTK.
- Print/save-as-PDF action on the user guide modal.

### Changed

- Consolidated the three hand-rolled modals (chart expand, wafer drilldown, user guide) into one shared `modal.ts` implementation.
- **wmap bumped to 0.17.0** — adds `--wmap-*` custom properties for chrome and canvas theming; all 8 app themes now apply to the embedded wafer view with no per-theme duplication (closes WMAP_ISSUES.md #25).
- Hardened the wmap link workflow: a release guard (`check-wmap-published.js`) fails a shippable build if wmap is still npm-linked or its published range isn't resolvable; `vite.config.ts` allow-lists the linked `../wmap` dir for the dev server.
- `actions/checkout` / `actions/setup-node` bumped to v5 in all workflows.
- Added `packages/parsers/README.md` documenting the testdata-parser WASM API.

### Fixed

- CI lint failure (`'controller' is never reassigned, use 'const'`) in `openWaferModal`, resolved as part of the modal consolidation above.

## [0.1.15] — 2026-07-01

### Added

- Shared themed hover tooltip (`tooltip.ts`) replacing native `title` tooltips across tsmap's own chrome (toolbar, chart-card and modal-header buttons, test selector).

### Changed

- **Chart bar drilldown is now a modal over the charts grid instead of a view switch** — clicking a bar opens `openWaferModal()` over the still-mounted grid; closing (Esc / close / backdrop) returns to the exact scroll position and selectors. The old bar multi-select ("shift-click to select several" + "Open selected") was removed in favour of single-click-to-open.
- **wmap bumped to 0.16.1** — first-class `zIndex` render option, replacing the previous global `--wmap-z` mutation workaround.

## [0.1.14] — 2026-06-25

### Added

- Test selector **"scan all N files"** toggle to widen the first-pass scan beyond the largest file, preserving selection across the re-scan.
- **"Value findings" toolbar toggle** to re-run wmap's regional test-value analysis in place on demand (disabled in the charts view, where it doesn't apply).

### Changed

- **Parser performance overhaul (testdata-parser 0.4.0)** — STDF now owns its own record framing/endianness/cold-record decoding (drops the `rust-stdf` dependency) with added big-endian support, ~13% faster (131→148 MB/s on the 341 MB fixture); CSV ~3.4× faster (16→55 MB/s); ATDF ~2.8× faster (22→60 MB/s) via positional field access; JSON gets a wide-format fast path.
- Adopted wmap 0.16.0's `enableTestValueAnalysis: false` default (regional test-value findings now opt-in) for a ~3.9× lot-pipeline speedup — see the new toggle above to restore them on demand.
- Window sizing: 80% of the monitor, centered, computed in Rust before first paint (no flash), 640×480 minimum.
- Missing facet values now fold into an explicit "(none)" group instead of being silently dropped from grouped charts.
- Relabelled the CSV "split" control to "Subdivide file by this column".

### Fixed

- Per-wafer metadata fields were silently dropped during multi-file merge, killing WIR/WRR facets — fixed via a single `toWaferData()` constructor used at every merge site.

## [0.1.13] — 2026-06-22

### Added

- RHEL 8 build + renamed release assets.
- **Lot/metadata faceting across all charts** — wafers now carry provenance (lot, program, tester, node, part type, sublot), surfaced via a "Group by" toolbar control that re-expresses every chart per group (yield, bin pareto, boxplot, histogram, correlation, scatter each do what suits their kind). wmap bumped to 0.15.0 to feed this metadata into map/gallery tooltips.
- **Generic, format-agnostic metadata extraction** (testdata-parser 0.3.1) — every non-empty STDF/ATDF MIR/WIR/WRR field is now emitted as a raw key/value pair and surfaced as a facet; CSV/JSON mapped metadata columns get the same treatment, closing the format-parity gap. New "Test site" CSV/JSON mapping role matches STDF/ATDF per-die site data.

### Fixed

- Correlation matrix no longer renders empty for a low-variation group — falls back to showing the tests with blank cells and a "No significant correlations found" note.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Self-contained "Matrix size" control on the correlation matrix** — the panel now owns a Matrix size selector (5–100 tests) that re-filters the full matrix and redraws in place, without rebuilding the charts grid. The caller persists the chosen limit; the panel reports strong/moderate/hidden pair counts and the strongest pair back through a summary line.
- **User guide modal gains a top header** — the in-app `?` guide now has a top header bar with **fullscreen** (toggle with the button or `F`) and **close** (`Esc`, backdrop click, or the icon) buttons, matching the chart expand-modal chrome. The old bottom-only "Close" button is gone. The guide content is capped to a readable 760px column so it doesn't stretch edge-to-edge when fullscreen.

### Changed

- **wafermap updated to 0.14.2** — picks up on-canvas map titles for every plot mode, a legend for `colorBySpec` (Spec pass/fail) mode, value-mode spec controls in the gallery toolbar, and a clearer log-scale colorbar note (`linear — log n/a` when log can't apply). Purely additive; no breaking changes.

### Fixed

- **CI type check failed on a clean checkout** — `src/userGuideHtml.ts` is generated (gitignored) by `npm run build:guide`, normally run by the `predev`/`prebuild` hooks. The `Test` job's `npm run check` had no such hook, so `tsc` couldn't resolve the import and both the Test and Deploy workflows failed. Added a `Build user guide` step before the type check in `test.yml`.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Spec limit lines on scatter plot** — when the selected X or Y test has spec limits (LSL/USL), dashed vertical lines (X limits) and horizontal lines (Y limits) are drawn on the scatter canvas. Together they form a pass-region rectangle when both tests have both limits.
- **"Axis includes limits" toggle on boxplot and histogram** — checkbox in each panel's controls row. When on, the axis range expands to include LSL/USL so limit lines are always visible even when they fall outside the data range. Default off (axis fits data only).
- **wmap geometry warnings in log panel** — `WaferMapResult.warnings` (new in wafermap 0.13.5) is now surfaced in the tsmap log panel. The `partial-coverage` advisory fires when inferred wafer geometry may be wrong due to partial data; it now appears as a visible warning instead of a silent `console.warn`.
- **Long-format CSV test data** — `scripts/generate_test_suite.py` generates `*_long.csv` files (one row per die per test with `test_name`, `test_val`, `lo_limit`, `hi_limit`, `units` columns). The mapping UI auto-detects these columns so limits are imported automatically.

### Fixed

- **Chart card PNG save broken** — removing the `HTMLAnchorElement.prototype.click` monkey-patch (see Changed below) also broke the ⤓ save buttons on chart cards (boxplot, histogram, correlation matrix, scatter). Fixed by threading `savePng` through `RenderChartsOptions` and all panel options interfaces down to `cardShell`, so each card's save button calls `platform.savePng` in Tauri and does a proper `document.body`-anchored browser download on web.

### Changed

- **wafermap updated to 0.13.5** — picks up performance improvements (`buildView` scan merges, `getDieAtPoint` spatial index), accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles), and two new features used by tsmap (see above).
- **PNG save hook replaces DOM monkey-patch** — `renderWaferMap` / `renderWaferGallery` now receive `onSaveImage` (new in wafermap 0.13.5) instead of the previous `HTMLAnchorElement.prototype.click` global override. Cleaner, host-agnostic, no longer affects every anchor on the page. Logged as WMAP_ISSUES.md #12; now resolved.
- **`dev:web` now binds to all interfaces** (`--host` flag added) so the web build is reachable from other devices on the local network (e.g. a Chromebook at `http://<host-ip>:5301`).
- **Lazy boxplot/trend quartile computation** — reverted `enableTestValueAnalysis: true` which caused a 5–8× slowdown on map load (wmap was running five Welch t-test region passes per wafer, per test, up-front — work tsmap never uses). Quartiles are now computed directly from die data in `buildTestBoxplotData` / `buildTrendData`, lazily on panel interaction. Logged as WMAP_ISSUES.md #14.

### Added

- **Web parsing runs in a Worker** — the browser build now parses STDF/ATDF/CSV/JSON in a dedicated module worker (`parserWorker.ts`) instead of on the UI thread, so large files no longer freeze the page. The `platform.ts` web branch routes all eight WASM entry points through the worker (id-correlated messages, bytes transferred, errors/traps reject the pending promise). Tauri is unaffected (it already parses off-thread via `spawn_blocking`).
- **Parser warnings channel** — parsers now return a `warnings: string[]` array (Rust `ParsedStdf.warnings`, TS `ParsedFile.warnings`). Soft-bin fabrication (the 65535 "no soft bin" sentinel mirrored onto the hard bin) is reported here and shown in the log panel instead of being silent. `@paulrobins/testdata-parser` 0.2.2.
- **CSV column mapping UI** — overlay shown after opening a CSV file. Detects column roles automatically (exact name, regex, and token-based fuzzy matching across 30+ naming conventions). User can reassign roles, rename test columns, mark metadata columns, set pass bins, and choose which metadata columns split the gallery into separate wafer cards. Mapping is saved to `localStorage` keyed by header fingerprint and pre-filled on next open of the same schema.
- **Long-format CSV support** — files where each row is one test result for one die (test_name / result columns with repeating X/Y) are detected automatically. A confirmation modal is shown; on confirm the data is pivoted to wide format in Rust before rendering.
- **Rust CSV parser** (`csv_headers` + `parse_csv` commands) — replaces the TypeScript parser. Uses the `csv` crate: streaming, handles quoted fields, BOM, `\r\n`, `#` comment lines, and any file size. Long-format pivot and wafer/split-by grouping run in Rust.
- **Lot-level analysis** — `analyzeWaferLot` is called for multi-wafer renders. The lot summary panel opens by default alongside the gallery, showing cross-wafer yield trends, bin aggregates, ring and quadrant summaries, and lot-level findings.
- **File drop** — files can now be dropped anywhere on the Tauri window. Uses `tauri://drag-drop` event (WebKitGTK intercepts OS drops before the browser sees them; `dragDropEnabled: true` in `tauri.conf.json`).
- **Log panel** — collapsible bar at the bottom of the window. All load events, warnings, and errors are timestamped and shown here. Auto-opens on error. Error count shown in the toggle label.
- **`read_text_file` Rust command** — reads any user-selected path without hitting `tauri-plugin-fs` scope restrictions (which only allow app-specific dirs by default).
- **Empty state** — clean startup screen with a wafer icon and "Open a file to get started" prompt. Replaces the confusing random demo data.

### Fixed

- **PNG save** — wmap creates a detached `<a download>` element that is never added to the DOM, so `document` capture listeners never fire. Fixed by patching `HTMLAnchorElement.prototype.click` in Tauri context.
- **PNG save filename** — zenity on Wayland ignores `--filename` when given a bare name. Pre-seed with `$HOME/<name>.png` so the dialog opens in the home directory with the filename populated.
- **Parser panic-safety on malformed files** — the STDF byte readers now bounds-check (return `Option`) instead of slicing raw, and an off-by-one guard in `parse_prr` was corrected. A truncated or corrupt file now returns an error rather than panicking — in WASM a panic aborted the whole module (blank page, no message). A `console_error_panic_hook` is installed in the WASM build so any residual panic surfaces as a console error. Covered by truncated-input regression tests.
- **STDF soft bin sentinel** — `PRR.soft_bin = 65535` means "not set" in STDF V4. Now falls back to `hard_bin` instead of passing `65535` to the frontend as a spurious soft bin value, and emits a log-panel warning when it does so (see the warnings channel above).
- **CSV/ATDF silent failures** — `tauri-plugin-fs` `fs:default` only allows access to app-specific directories. Text files selected via zenity can be anywhere; now read via `read_text_file` Rust command instead.
- **Column mapping overlay covering gallery toolbar** — overlay changed from `position: absolute` (inside `#map-container`) to `position: fixed; z-index: 200`, covering the entire app window including the wmap toolbar.
- **Gallery not scrollable** — added `overflow-y: auto` to the container in gallery mode.
- **Dark mode form elements** — Ubuntu GTK / WebKitGTK imposes the system light theme on `select` and `input` elements regardless of CSS background. Fixed with `color-scheme: dark`, `-webkit-appearance: none`, and `!important` colour overrides.
- **ATDF and JSON not loading** — these now read via `read_text_file` Rust command, bypassing the `tauri-plugin-fs` scope restriction.
- **ATDF missing from non-Linux file picker** — `tauri-plugin-dialog` filters on macOS/Windows now include `.atdf` and `.atd`.

### Changed

- **Map fills window on resize** — removed the constraining `display: flex; align-items: center` wrapper. wmap's internal `ResizeObserver` re-fits the canvas automatically when the container resizes.
- **Default window size** — increased from 800×600 to 1200×800.
- **TypeScript CSV parser removed** — all CSV parsing now goes through Rust.
- **Charts split into per-chart modules** — the 1,700-line `charts/render.ts` is now one module per chart (`boxplot.ts`, `histogram.ts`, `correlation.ts`, `trend.ts`, `scatter.ts`) sharing chrome from `charts/chartShell.ts`. `render.ts` keeps the bar-chart panel + grid and re-exports the rest, so importers are unchanged. No behaviour change.
